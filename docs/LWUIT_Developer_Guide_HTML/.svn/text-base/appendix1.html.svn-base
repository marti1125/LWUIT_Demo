<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e7087"></a>This appendix addresses common questions about LWUIT.</p>
<div class="qanda"><a name="d0e7090"></a><div class="qandaentry"><a name="d0e7091"></a><p class="question"><b>Question: Performance
on the Wireless Toolkit is very slow, what is the problem?</b></p>
<p class="answer"><b>Answer: </b>There are documented issues of slow performance due
to Hyperthreading. </p>
<ul class="bullet1" type="square"><li class="bullet1"><p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e7102"></a>There are documented
issues of slow performance due to Hyperthreading. </p></li>
<li class="bullet1"><p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e7106"></a>Slow loopback in the network interface (often caused
by miss-configured networking) also impacts performance because
the toolkit uses network calls to perform all drawing.</p></li>
<li class="bullet1"><p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e7110"></a>Sprint WirelessToolkit versions 3.2 and higher do
not have these performance issues because they feature a different
architecture. </p></li></ul></div>
<div class="qandaentry"><a name="d0e7113"></a><p class="question"><b>Question: How does <a class="indexterm" name="d0e7117"></a>painting
in LWUIT differ from Swing/AWT?</b></p>
<p class="answer"><b>Answer: </b>Generally both are very much alike. There are, however,
some minor key differences that might &#8220;bite&#8221; an
unsuspecting Swing/AWT developer:</p>
<ul class="bullet1" type="square"><li class="bullet1"><p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e7128"></a>LWUIT clears the background &#8211; when
drawing the component LWUIT makes sure to first clear the background
for the component using the painters for its parents if necessary.</p></li>
<li class="bullet1"><p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e7132"></a>LWUIT translates to parent component coordinates &#8211; A
Swing component always starts at 0, 0. This is because Graphics.translate
is invoked with the X and Y coordinates of the component. In LWUIT
this is done only for parent containers, which is why the components
in LWUIT must be drawn in their X and Y location.

The problem with this approach is that drawing in 0,0 often works
for the first component in the container and fail for subsequent
components.</p></li>
<li class="bullet1"><p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e7136"></a>LWUIT doesn't make a distinction between paintContent
or paintChildren &#8211; All calls in LWUIT lead to paint and
paintBorder. There is no separate call for painting the children
of a container.</p></li></ul></div>
<div class="qandaentry"><a name="d0e7139"></a><p class="question"><b>Question: Scrolling isn't working like I expect,
what went wrong?</b></p>
<p class="answer"><b>Answer: </b>There are several common possibilities.</p>
<ul class="bullet1" type="square"><li class="bullet1"><p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e7150"></a>You nested a scrollable component
within another scrollable component (this is technically legal but
might look odd). By default the form is scrollable so just try invoking
setScrollableY(false) on the form.</p></li>
<li class="bullet1"><p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e7154"></a>Scrolling behaves based on the amount of space allocated
by the layout manager. Some layout managers do everything to prevent
scrolling (such as grid layout) while the box layout tries to increase
size as much as possible. Read the documentation for your layout
manager of choice.</p></li>
<li class="bullet1"><p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e7158"></a>For group layout components (generated by the UI
builder) you must make sure to mark components to grow and verify
that they indeed do so in preview mode. You must size the container
to match the size of the component boundaries, otherwise the container
size will be hardcoded.</p></li></ul></div>
<div class="qandaentry"><a name="d0e7161"></a><p class="question"><b>Question: What is a <a class="indexterm" name="d0e7165"></a>painter?
Why not just use an image?</b></p>
<p class="answer"><b>Answer: </b>The idea behind a painter is simple, provide flexibility
to the developer and allow the developer to define rendering suitable
for his needs on any device. While images provide decent flexibility
for artists&#8217; ideas, painters provide limitless flexibility:</p>
<ul class="bullet1" type="square"><li class="bullet1"><p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e7176"></a>A developer can use a relatively low
overhead gradient painter to get a very compelling look without
a single additional image file. Furthermore, the gradient adapts
nicely to any screen resolution.</p></li>
<li class="bullet1"><p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e7180"></a>	In high&#8208;end devices that support SVG,
etcetera, painters can use SVG to render and scale vector graphics
rather than scale raster graphics. This increases the application
UI fidelity. </p></li></ul></div>
<div class="qandaentry"><a name="Z40006881293892"></a><p class="question"><b>Question: Is LWUIT identical
across all platforms?</b></p>
<p class="answer"><b>Answer: </b>Yes and No.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e7192"></a>The basic core API is the same on most tested platforms and
is binary compatible, allowing MIDP applications to run on Java
SE (for example, in the Theme Creator actual MIDlet code is running
in Java SE).</p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e7195"></a>The catch is in several details:</p>
<ul class="bullet1" type="square"><li class="bullet1"><p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e7200"></a>	Some components aren't available
in other platforms: M3G, Media (sometimes available), and SVG.</p></li>
<li class="bullet1"><p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e7204"></a>	Rendering might seem different on other platforms
due to platform issues. For example, in some platforms LWUIT takes
advantage of anti-aliasing. System fonts look completely different
between platforms and bitmap fonts look odd in some platforms that
don't properly support alpha channels.</p></li>
<li class="bullet1"><p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e7208"></a>	Different platforms have different performance
characteristics.</p></li></ul>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e7211"></a>For more details on these issues check out the portability
chapter.</p></div>
<div class="qandaentry"><a name="Z40006881294100"></a><p class="question"><b>Question: Does LWUIT support
3 SoftButton devices?</b></p>
<p class="answer"><b>Answer: </b>Yes, 3 SoftButton mode is implemented in display.
However, since there is no reliable way to detect 3 SoftButton phones
this features can be activated either programmatically or through
a JAD file attribute.</p></div>
<div class="qandaentry"><a name="Z40006881294617"></a><p class="question"><b>Question: A device doesn't
seem to work with LWUIT. What should I do?</b></p>
<p class="answer"><b>Answer: </b>Is it a MIDP 2.0/CLDC 1.1 device? If it is then please
mail lwuit@sun.com with the following additional details:</p>
<ul class="bullet1" type="square"><li class="bullet1"><p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e7234"></a>Does LWUIT hello world work on the
device?</p></li>
<li class="bullet1"><p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e7238"></a>Does the LWUIT UIDemo work on the device?</p></li>
<li class="bullet1"><p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e7242"></a>What is the resolution+color depth of the device,
and how much memory is allocated for Java?</p></li></ul></div>
<div class="qandaentry"><a name="Z40006881294796"></a><p class="question"><b>Question: I want my application
to look "native" on the device. Is there any way to accomplish that?</b></p>
<p class="answer"><b>Answer: </b>While LWUIT is designed to do the exact opposite (support
your own look and feel) a native look and feel can be partially
achieved if you implement a theme or look and feel that resembles
the native look.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e7254"></a>This won't work very well on most devices since there is no
way to detect if the user switched the default theme.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e7257"></a>Downloadable themes are probably a good approach for a strong
user community.</p></div>
<div class="qandaentry"><a name="Z40006881294979"></a><p class="question"><b>Question: The UI for my<a class="indexterm" name="d0e7264"></a> touch screen phone seems
too small for my fingers. How do I make the UI more appropriate
for such a device?</b></p>
<p class="answer"><b>Answer: </b>Use a global padding setting in the theme to increase
the size of all widgets to a point where they are big enough for
a finger tip.</p></div>
<div class="qandaentry"><a name="Z40027371295080"></a><p class="question"><b>Question: Why am I getting
memory errors in LWUIT? Why is LWUIT is consuming a lot of memory
in my memory monitor?</b></p>
<p class="answer"><b>Answer: </b>Check that your application doesn't hold onto pointers
for components. Because a component references its parent component,
holding onto a single button can keep an entire form with all its
content in memory... LWUIT allocates and discards frequently to
allow for a small memory footprint. This causes the graph of free
memory to fluctuate but the alternative of caching would be worse
for highly constrained devices. Check out the LWUIT blog for more
information on the subject of tracking and identifying memory issues. </p></div>
<div class="qandaentry"><a name="d0e7283"></a><p class="question"><b>Question: Why won't my list/text area scroll?
Why does my list/text area jump around?</b></p>
<p class="answer"><b>Answer: </b>You need to disable the scrolling for the form using myForm.setScrollable(false)
and you should place the list in the center of a border layout.
For deeper understanding of why this is required, read the next
question about scrolling.</p></div>
<div class="qandaentry"><a name="d0e7292"></a><p class="question"><b>Question: How can I make scrolling more elaborate?
Does LWUIT only support scrolling based on focus? Why isn't scrolling
of an element larger than screen size supported?</b></p>
<p class="answer"><b>Answer: </b>LWUIT features an open interface for scrolling, allowing
any component to define the way in which it wishes to scroll. This
interface is used by the TextArea and List components to implement
their internal scroll functionality.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e7301"></a>LWUIT doesn't scroll containers. Instead it provides focus
traversal, which causes scrolling to the focused component. This
is a very powerful approach (and very common on small devices) since
it allows easy interaction. However, in some circumstances (mostly
viewers) LWUIT focus-based scrolling doesn't behave as expected.
Since the scrolling architecture is exposed, developers can extend container
and override the scrolling/key handling to behave as expected.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e7304"></a>Scrolling a single component which is larger than the screen
isn't supported by LWUIT containers. (This is a very difficult edge
case for focus based scrolling). Scrolling multiple smaller components
is not a problem.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e7307"></a>Community member Elliot Long contributed his own solution
to "visual scrolling" which allows scrolling without focus. The
LWUIT blog covers simple image scrolling and explains the details
here.</p></div>
<div class="qandaentry"><a name="d0e7310"></a><p class="question"><b>Question: How do I change the appearance of the
list? Remove the numbers from the side etcetera? Can I nest containers
in the list?</b></p>
<p class="answer"><b>Answer: </b>List is designed for a very large number of element
and fast traversal. You can use its cell renderer facility to customize
it any way you want as explained here. How the list can scale and
grow is explained here and additionally here.</p></div>
<div class="qandaentry"><a name="d0e7319"></a><p class="question"><b>Question: My application freezes or stalls. How
do I fix this?</b></p>
<p class="answer"><b>Answer: </b>99% of the problems of this type are related to Event
Dispatch Thread (EDT) violations. The EDT broadcasts all the events
in LWUIT. It is also responsible for drawing all elements on the
screen.The EDT thread is responsible for drawing all screen elements,
if it is blocked by a long running operation elements won't update
and key/pointer events won't be received. The solution is to use
threads for such long running tasks, however interaction with LWUIT
can only be performed on the EDT. To return into the EDT you can
use Display.callSerially/callSeriallyAndWait. A different option
is to use invokeAndBlock.</p></div>
<div class="qandaentry"><a name="d0e7328"></a><p class="question"><b>Question: I'm not opening any threads, why am
I having problems? </b></p>
<p class="answer"><b>Answer: </b>A typical application always uses at least two threads,
lifecycle and the EDT. The lifecycle thread is the callback thread
used for the application. For example, in MIDP the startApp method
is invoked from the MIDP thread which is different from the EDT.</p></div>
<div class="qandaentry"><a name="d0e7337"></a><p class="question"><b>Question: Does anything work from a separate thread?</b></p>
<p class="answer"><b>Answer: </b>There are no guarantees, but repaint() should generally
work from every thread and show() should as well.</p></div>
<div class="qandaentry"><a name="d0e7346"></a><p class="question"><b>Question: How do I reposition/resize a dialog? </b></p>
<p class="answer"><b>Answer: </b>Use a Dialog instance and a version of show which
accepts 4 integer values to position the dialog. You can use the
set the default dialog position to simplify dialog positioning.</p></div>
<div class="qandaentry"><a name="d0e7355"></a><p class="question"><b>Question: How do I show Video?</b></p>
<p class="answer"><b>Answer: </b>Use MMAPI to create a Player object, then submit it
to the MediaComponent class. </p></div>
<div class="qandaentry"><a name="d0e7364"></a><p class="question"><b>Question: How do I show SVG/3D?</b></p>
<p class="answer"><b>Answer: </b>Use the M3G API or the SVGImage API to place such
elements in the UI.</p></div>
<div class="qandaentry"><a name="d0e7373"></a><p class="question"><b>Question: Can I create my own components?</b></p>
<p class="answer"><b>Answer: </b>Everything in LWUIT is fully extensible.You can derive
from any component and extend it. It is demonstrated in the <a href="chapter15.html#CHECEECE">Chapter 15</a> and it is discussed extensively
in the blog. </p></div>
<div class="qandaentry"><a name="d0e7384"></a><p class="question"><b>Question: I'm trying to display an animated gif.
Why isn't it working? </b></p>
<p class="answer"><b>Answer: </b>Animated gifs can be shown in MIDP using the MMAPI
and MediaComponent (see the MMAPI question). LWUIT has special support
for StaticAnimation which is a LWUIT specific format very similar
to the animated gif. Both the Theme Creator and the Ant task accept
animated GIF files to create static animations. </p></div>
<div class="qandaentry"><a name="d0e7393"></a><p class="question"><b>Question: Why am I having problems on the BlackBerry? </b></p>
<p class="answer"><b>Answer: </b>The BlackBerry VM has some issues with linking to
classes that aren't on the device. A BlackBerry-specific version
built with the BlackBerry VM is necessary. See the LWUIT-incubator
project for a community built port for the BlackBerry. There is
another BlackBerry port within the LWUIT project version control
system.</p></div>
<div class="qandaentry"><a name="Z40027371358334"></a><p class="question"><b>Question: I'm having issues
on a Windows Mobile device?</b></p>
<p class="answer"><b>Answer: </b>Windows mobile VMs vary significantly in their quality.
If the VM is giving you problems try the Phone ME open source VM
port for Windows mobile devices.</p></div>
<div class="qandaentry"><a name="Z40027371358321"></a><p class="question"><b>Question: How do I create
resource (.res) files? </b></p>
<p class="answer"><b>Answer: </b>Use the Theme Creator (formerly the Resource Editor)
or the Ant task.<a class="indexterm" name="d0e7419"></a> </p></div>
<div class="qandaentry"><a name="Z40027371358308"></a><p class="question"><b>Question: What is the difference
between the Theme Creator (formerly the Resource Editor) and the
Ant task?</b></p>
<p class="answer"><b>Answer: </b>The difference is mainly in the use case, the ant
tool is designed mostly for developer related resources (locales,
application images, etcetera). The Theme Creator is designed for
use by graphics designers. </p></div></div>
