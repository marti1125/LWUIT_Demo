<div class="highlights"><p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6545"></a>While <a class="indexterm" name="d0e6547"></a>portability
is one of LWUIT&#8217;s best attributes, it is also one of the hardest features
to grasp. LWUIT is portable as a library and it also enables application porting
in such a way that binary code or source can be compatible across
different Java ME profiles.</p></div>
<div class="sect1"><a name="d0e6552"></a><hr align="left" size="6" width="15%" noshade="1"><h1 class="head1"><a name="d0e6553"></a>16.1 Introduction</h1>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6556"></a>Much has been said in the past about Java device fragmentation
(write once debug everywhere). To understand LWUIT's portability
you must first understand the original problems and the solutions
LWUIT provides for each problem:</p>
<ul class="bullet1" type="square"><li class="bullet1"><p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6561"></a>Low quality or buggy implementations
of the specification</p>
<p class="paraindent1"><a name="d0e6564"></a>This problem was far more severe with older (prior to CLDC
1.1) devices that LWUIT does not support. Thanks to modern TCKs,
the virtual machine (VM) in modern devices is compatible, and furthermore
the UI layer on which LWUIT is based is very narrow and relatively
robust across devices.</p></li>
<li class="bullet1"><p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6568"></a>Low power, low memory devices</p>
<p class="paraindent1"><a name="d0e6571"></a>Again with newer CLDC 1.1 devices this is not as much of a
problem as it used to be, but there are still concerns. See <a href="chapter2.html#CEHGAEFC">Chapter 2</a> for a discussion on increasing performance
and reducing memory overhead (sometimes trading off one for the other).</p></li>
<li class="bullet1"><p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6577"></a>Varying screen resolutions</p>
<p class="paraindent1"><a name="d0e6580"></a>LWUIT ships with a very fast low memory overhead scaling algorithm
that doesn't lose transparency information. For extreme cases where
the algorithm is not enough, LWUIT supports pluggable themes, allowing
the UI to be customized with images more fitting to the resolution
of the phone.</p></li>
<li class="bullet1"><p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6584"></a>Varying input methods</p>
<p class="paraindent1"><a name="d0e6587"></a>LWUIT detects soft buttons automatically, and navigation is
already portable. LWUIT supports touch screens seamlessly out of
the box. Text input works with the device native text box, ensuring
proper input.</p></li>
<li class="bullet1"><p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6591"></a>Over-The-Air (OTA) code size limitations</p>
<p class="paraindent1"><a name="d0e6594"></a>This problem is solving itself, given relaxed carrier restrictions
and increasing JAR file size allocations. LWUIT fully supports obfuscation
and works properly with obfuscators that remove redundant code.</p></li>
<li class="bullet1"><p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6598"></a>Non-UI related pitfalls (networking issues, RMS
incompatibility, etcetera)</p>
<p class="paraindent1"><a name="d0e6601"></a>LWUIT currently focuses only on UI related issues, so you
must find your own solution for the many minor issues related to
these problems. For most common use cases failure occurs because
the device expects the &#8220;right thing&#8221;. For example, networking
is problematic on some devices due to a connection that was never closed,
and so forth.</p></li></ul></div>
<div class="sect1"><a name="d0e6604"></a><hr align="left" size="6" width="15%" noshade="1"><h1 class="head1"><a name="d0e6605"></a>16.2 Performance</h1>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6608"></a>Performance is a huge problem in portability. Problems in <a class="indexterm" name="d0e6610"></a>performance often creep on
an application only to appear later in its life cycle. Performance
is often a trade-off, mostly of memory for CPU or visa versa. The
easiest way to improve performance is to reduce functionality.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6616"></a>Since LWUIT has pluggable theming you can substitute a simple
theme without changing code. This makes it easier to see whether
the problem is in the UI itself.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6619"></a>The following subsections discuss the specifics of memory
and responsiveness. One thing to keep in mind is that performance
and memory use on an emulator is no indication of device performance
and memory overhead.</p>
<div class="sect2"><a name="d0e6622"></a><h2 class="head2"><a name="d0e6623"></a>16.2.1 Memory</h2>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6626"></a>This section discussions factors that impact memory and speed.</p>
<a name="d0e6629"></a><div class="sect3"><h3 class="head3"><a name="d0e6630"></a>16.2.1.1 Indexed Images</h3>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6633"></a><a class="indexterm" name="d0e6634"></a>Memory is problematic,
especially when programming small devices. When using LWUIT you
must understand how memory directly relates to resolution and bit depth.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6642"></a>Assume you have two devices, a 16&#8208;bit color (65536
colors) device with 128x128 resolution that has 2 megabytes of memory
and a 24&#8208;bit color device (1.6 million colors) with a 320x240
resolution and 3 megabytes of memory. </p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6645"></a>Which device provides more memory for an LWUIT application?
The answer is not so simple. </p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6648"></a>Assume both devices have a background image set and scaled,
so they need enough RAM to hold the uncompressed image in memory.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6651"></a>The smaller device needs 32,768 bytes just for a background
buffer of the screen. The larger device requires 307,200 bytes for
the same buffer!</p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6654"></a>Because screen buffers are needed both for the current form,
the current transition (twice), and the MIDP implementation, the
amount of memory the larger device consumes is staggering! </p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6657"></a>How did we reach these numbers?</p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6660"></a>The simple formula is:</p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6663"></a><var class="replaceable">screen width</var> * <var class="replaceable">screen
height</var> * <var class="replaceable">bytes per pixel</var> =
memory</p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6674"></a>Therefore:</p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6677"></a>16 bit: 128 * 128 * 2 = 32,768</p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6680"></a>24 bit: 320 * 240 * 4 = 307,200</p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6683"></a>Notice that in the 24&#8208;bit device 24 bits are counted
as an integer because there is no 24&#8208;bit primitive and
implementations treat 24&#8208;bit color as 32&#8208;bit color.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6686"></a>So getting back to the two devices, in the worst case scenario
four buffers are immediately consumed, and the remaining RAM compares
as follows:</p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6689"></a>16 bit: 2,097,152 &#8211; 32,768 * 4 = 1,966,125</p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6692"></a>24 bit: 3,145,728 &#8211; 307,200 * 4 = 1,916,928</p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6695"></a>It turns out the 24&#8208;bit device has more RAM to begin
with but doesn't have as much RAM to work with!</p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6698"></a>Notice that all of these calculations don't take into account
the additional memory overhead required for LWUIT and your application.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6701"></a>Thankfully, LWUIT offers a partial solution in the form of
indexed images, which turn this:</p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6704"></a>24 bit: 320 * 240 * 4 = 307,200</p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6707"></a>Into this (approximately, could be slightly less):</p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6710"></a>24 bit: 320 * 240 + 1kb= 77,824</p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6713"></a>Indexed images perform this magic by storing images as byte
arrays with a lookup table. They trade off memory overhead for drawing
performance, but in general on&#8208;device performance is good.
Another drawback of indexed images is a restriction to no more than
256 colors per indexed image.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6716"></a>By using <a class="indexterm" name="d0e6718"></a>indexed
images (animations are always indexed) you reduce most of the memory
overhead on the device at little cost. This changes the result of
the previous example considerably:</p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6723"></a>16 bit: 2,097,152 &#8211; 17,408 * 4 = 2,027,520</p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6726"></a>24 bit: 3,145,728 &#8211; 77,824 * 4 = 2,834,432</p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6729"></a>Using indexed images, a UI&#8208;heavy application can
be run on a 2 megabyte 320x240 24&#8208;bit color device. Note
that using tiled images or a solid color to fill the background
is even &#8220;cheaper&#8221; than the savings reachable using
indexed images. </p></div>
<a name="d0e6732"></a><div class="sect3"><h3 class="head3"><a name="d0e6733"></a>16.2.1.2 Light Mode</h3>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6736"></a>Some of the default settings in LWUIT are memory intensive
because LWUIT is designed for higher memory devices. However, LWUIT
has a special flag to accommodate low memory devices and it can
be activated in Display. Display's <kbd class="command">init()</kbd> method
initializes the flag to a sensible default value which affects the
way bitmap fonts and other LWUIT features utilize memory. </p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6742"></a>This flag can be activated manually for devices that experience
memory problems, and it can be used by third&#8208;party applications
to decide on caches, sizes, and so forth.</p></div></div>
<div class="sect2"><a name="d0e6745"></a><h2 class="head2"><a name="d0e6746"></a>16.2.2 Speed </h2>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6749"></a>UI speed is often a user perception rather than a &#8220;real&#8221; performance
issue. Slow performance happens, but a developer&#8217;s opinion of performance
may not match an end-user&#8217;s perception. The best way to measure
the speed of a UI is to give devices to a focus group of objective
people and ask them how the UI &#8220;feels&#8221;. </p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6752"></a>That said, the following subsections you can monitor the event
dispatch thread and </p>
<a name="d0e6755"></a><div class="sect3"><h3 class="head3"><a name="d0e6756"></a>16.2.2.1 Event Dispatch Thread (EDT)</h3>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6759"></a>Performance often suffers because of slow paints. This often
occurs when the <a class="indexterm" name="d0e6761"></a>EDT
is being used without being released. It&#8217;s important not to &#8220;hold&#8221; the
EDT and release it immediately when performing long running tasks.
For further details on releasing the EDT see Display methods <kbd class="command">callSerially</kbd>, <kbd class="command">callSeriallyAndWait</kbd>,
and <kbd class="command">invokeAndBlock</kbd>.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6775"></a>The EDT might be blocked due to unrelated work on a different
thread. Bad thread scheduling on devices causes this problem, in
part because many hardware devices ignore thread priorities. </p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6778"></a>On some devices networking can cause a visible stall in the
UI, a problem for which there is no &#8220;real&#8221; solution.
The workaround for such cases is logical rather than technical.
In this case a standard progress indicator stalls during a networking operation.
It might work better to use a progress indicator heuristic that
moves slower or does not move at all so the user is less likely
to notice the interruption in the display.</p></div>
<a name="d0e6781"></a><div class="sect3"><h3 class="head3"><a name="d0e6782"></a>16.2.2.2 LWUIT Performance</h3>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6785"></a>Different transition types have different performance overheads
on devices. Play with the transition selection and possibly disable
transitions if necessary. </p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6788"></a>Indexed <a class="indexterm" name="d0e6790"></a>images <a class="indexterm" name="d0e6794"></a>carry a performance overhead.
It shouldn't be excessive, but when using many animations or indexed
images you can expect a slower repaint cycle, especially on devices
without a JIT or fast CPU.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6803"></a>Light mode often trades speed for memory overhead. If there
is plenty of memory and low performance, explicitly turning off
light mode (after <kbd class="command">Display.init()</kbd>) might impact
speed.</p></div></div></div>
<div class="sect1"><a name="d0e6809"></a><hr align="left" size="6" width="15%" noshade="1"><h1 class="head1"><a name="d0e6810"></a>16.3 Device Bugs And Limitations</h1>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6813"></a>This section describes the device bugs and limitations the
LWUIT development team found while in the process of creating demos
and applications. While this is not an exhaustive list, you can
apply these principles if you encounter device issues of your own.</p>
<div class="sect2"><a name="d0e6816"></a><h2 class="head2"><a name="d0e6817"></a>16.3.1 Bugs</h2>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6820"></a>The LWUIT development team encountered several device bugs
and limitations (but not nearly as many as were expected). The first
rule of bug investigation is:</p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6823"></a><i>It is not a VM bug.</i></p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6827"></a>Often developers blame the VM for bugs. Despite many rumors,
the development team hasn&#8217;t found a CLDC 1.1 VM with a significant
bug (they reproduced crashes, but they were all due to bad API implementations). </p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6830"></a>The VM and GC seem to work pretty flawlessly, which means
several things should work. You should be able to rely on proper
exception handling and proper class loading behavior. This essentially
allows you to use Java technology for exception handling and class
loading to work with multiple devices, instead of the &#8220;problematic&#8221; preprocessor
statements used in the past.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6833"></a>The preprocessor approach was essential in the past when targeting
all phones (even seriously broken VMs) with code size requirements
that were very low. Today&#8217;s market has changed considerably, both
in the quality of the common devices and in the space or OTA code
size available for a typical application. </p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6836"></a>The advantages of avoiding preprocessor are mostly in code
maintenance (refactoring, compiler checks, etcetera), simplicity
in reusing object oriented paradigms, and easier deployment (one
JAR file for all or most devices).</p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6839"></a>Rather than beat around the bush, here are a few examples
of actual device behaviors:</p>
<ul class="bullet1" type="square"><li class="bullet1"><p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6844"></a>A device throws an exception in a
certain condition when using an API. This happens with several devices
that fail in <kbd class="command">drawRGB</kbd>. The solution is to catch
the exception and activate a flag to invoke a different code path
designed for that device class only.</p></li>
<li class="bullet1"><p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6851"></a>Some devices have a bug with API <var class="replaceable">X</var> or
with a specific usage of API <var class="replaceable">X</var>. Avoid
that API or usage if possible. For example, many devices have a
problem with<a class="indexterm" name="d0e6859"></a> <kbd class="command">flushGraphics(int, int, int, int)</kbd>,
but all devices tested worked perfectly with <kbd class="command">flushGraphics()</kbd>. </p></li></ul>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6870"></a>As you can see, you can rely on Java working properly and
throwing exceptions, making it possible to implement workarounds
on the fly.</p></div>
<div class="sect2"><a name="d0e6873"></a><h2 class="head2"><a name="d0e6874"></a>16.3.2 Limitations</h2>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6877"></a>The rules for dealing with device limitations are very similar
to the rules for dealing with device bugs. If a missing API is invoked
in code, it throws an exception because it doesn't exist. You can
catch that exception and activate a flag disabling the functionality
related to the feature. For example, your application might offer
a location based feature based on JSR 179. You can wrap the calls
related to JSR 179 code in try/catch and disable the functionality
if a Throwable is thrown by the code (for example, <kbd class="command">NoSuchMethodError</kbd> or <kbd class="command">ClassNotFoundException</kbd>).</p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6886"></a>An example of this approach exists in the M3G class from LWUIT
which is designed to run on devices that do not support JSR 184.
The Log class is also designed in a similar way. It can utilize
the <kbd class="command">FileConnector</kbd> when the API is available in
order to log to the device file system rather than RMS.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6892"></a>Limitations are often related to appearance, number of colors,
device speed, device resolution, and so forth. These can be worked
around using a multitude of themes and picking the right default
theme upon startup. Use the methods in Display to check general
device capabilities, then enable or disable some features. </p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6895"></a>For example, some devices support only three alpha levels
(0%, 50%, 100%). This causes anti-aliased fonts to look horrible
on those devices especially when using white over black color schemes.
Devices like these can be easily detected using <a class="indexterm" name="d0e6897"></a><kbd class="command">Display.numAlphaLevels()</kbd> and
such themes can be disabled on these devices (or simply excluded
from the default state). Similar properties such as <kbd class="command">numColors</kbd> are
available on display.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6907"></a>Speed and memory constraints are much harder to detect on
the fly. <kbd class="command">TotalMemory</kbd> is often incorrect on devices
and speed is notoriously hard to detect. True memory heap can be
detected by allocating byte arrays until an <kbd class="command">OutOfMemoryError</kbd> is thrown.
While the VM is not guaranteed to be stable after an OOM it generally recovers
nicely. Store the amount of memory in RMS to avoid the need to repeat
this exercise.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6916"></a>The best solution is to allow your users as much configurability
as possible (to themes, animations, transitions, etcetera) thus
giving them the choice to tailor the application to their device
needs.</p></div></div>
<div class="sect1"><a name="d0e6919"></a><hr align="left" size="6" width="15%" noshade="1"><h1 class="head1"><a name="d0e6920"></a>16.4 Resolution Independence</h1>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6923"></a>One of the biggest problems in Java ME programming is the
selection of device resolutions. This problem is aggravated by lack
of scaling support and the small selection of devices with SVG device.
A bigger problem than multiple resolutions is the problem of varying
aspect ratios, even changing in runtime on the same device! (For
example some slider devices change resolution and aspect ratio on
the fly.)<a class="indexterm" name="d0e6925"></a></p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6929"></a>LWUIT solves the lack of scaling support by including a fast
low overhead scaling algorithm that keeps the image&#8217;s alpha channel
intact. Scaling on devices is far from ideal for some image types.
It is recommended that designers avoid &#8220;fine details&#8221; in images
that are destined for scaling. </p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6932"></a>Since images and themes can be stored in resource bundles,
such bundles can be conditionally used to support different resolutions.
This solution is not practical on a grand scale with a single JAR
file strategy, however, for some basic resolution and important
images this is a very practical solution, especially when dynamically downloading
resources from a server.</p></div>
<div class="sect1"><a name="d0e6935"></a><hr align="left" size="6" width="15%" noshade="1"><h1 class="head1"><a name="d0e6936"></a>16.5 Input</h1>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6939"></a>This section describes input methods that LWUIT supports.</p>
<div class="sect2"><a name="d0e6942"></a><h2 class="head2"><a name="d0e6943"></a>16.5.1 Soft Buttons</h2>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6946"></a>Soft <a class="indexterm" name="d0e6948"></a>buttons
for common devices in the market are detected automatically by LWUIT.
If LWUIT fails to detect a specific device a developer can still
set the key code for the soft keys using setter methods in Display.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6953"></a>LWUIT supports 3 SoftButton navigation common in newer phones
from Sony Ericsson and Nokia. The 3 SoftButton mode can be activated
via the Display class. In this mode the center &#8220;fire&#8221; key
acts as a soft button. </p></div>
<div class="sect2"><a name="CEHFCGII"></a><h2 class="head2"><a name="d0e6957"></a>16.5.2 Back Button</h2>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6960"></a><a class="indexterm" name="d0e6961"></a>Some
devices, most commonly older Sony Ericsson devices, have a special hardcoded
back button device. You can assign a command as a &#8220;back
command&#8221; using the form method for determining the back
command. This ensures that only one command at any given time is
deemed as a back command. The back command can also be configured
using the Display methods. Currently the back button is only supported
on Sony Ericsson devices. </p></div>
<div class="sect2"><a name="d0e6966"></a><h2 class="head2"><a name="d0e6967"></a>16.5.3 Touch Screen Devices</h2>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6970"></a>Touch screens are supported out of the box, however, designing
a UI for finger operation is very different from designing a UI
for general use. Finger operations expect everything to be accessible
via taps (not keys). <a class="indexterm" name="d0e6972"></a></p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6976"></a>A touch interface expects widgets to be big enough to fit
the size of a human finger. This is somewhat counter-intuitive because
normally you might want to cram as much UI detail as possible into
a single screen to avoid scrolling. </p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6979"></a>Component sizes can be easily customized globally using the
theme. Simply set the default padding attribute to a large enough
value (e.g. 5, 5, 5, 5) and all widgets &#8220;grow&#8221; to
suit finger navigation. It is also a good practice to use buttons
for touch devices and avoid menus where possible.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6982"></a>The only problem is that currently there is no standard code
that allows you to detect touch screen devices on the fly. However
such information can be easily placed in the Java application descriptor
(JAD) file for the application to query.</p></div></div>

<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6989"></a>This list is rather limited since the development team doesn't
have much to say about most devices. Most of the common CLDC 1.1
devices just work out of the box without much of a hassle. This
section describes behaviors that might catch developers off guard.
This is by no means an exhaustive or definitive list.</p>

<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e6996"></a>The RAZR family doesn't support different levels of translucency
-only 50% translucency is supported. This causes anti-aliased fonts
to look bad on these devices.</p></div>

<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e7003"></a>Since the BlackBerry doesn't have soft keys they are mapped
to the Q/W and P/O keyboard keys. In order to build a release for
the BlackBerry a COD file must be produced with the BlackBerry Java
Development Environment (JDE), otherwise the MIDlet JAR file size
is too big for the BlackBerry device.</p>

<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e7038"></a>Generally series 40 devices work well. Some &#8220;high
end&#8221; S40 devices only contain 2mb of memory yet have 24&#8208;bit
color 320x240 resolutions. These devices have 3mb installed but
only 2mb is accessible to Java applications. </p>

of the devices.</p></div>

<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e7048"></a>Sony Ericsson makes good Java devices that are indexed with
memory and have 16&#8208;bit color for even better memory.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e7051"></a>The Back button, as discussed in <a href="chapter16.html#CEHFCGII">Back Button</a> exists in SE until JP-8, at
which point a new interface based on three soft keys was introduced. </p>
<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e7056"></a>Native Networking Sony Ericsson threads in SE tend to freeze
the GUI. The devices in JP-7 and newer completely ignore thread
priorities as well. </p></div>

<p class="paragraph"><a name="d0e7063"></a>Test on manufacturers emulators. While development is easier
using the Sun Java Wireless Toolkit and Sprint Wireless Toolkit,
there is no substitute for occasional emulator test. An emulator
provides more accurate memory readings especially related to images
and buffers.</p></div></div>
